## Welcome message

:ttw-logo: :sparkles: Welcome to The Turing Way slack, and to this community space! We’re so glad you’re here! :sparkles::ttw-logo:

:one: About this workspace
If you’d like to learn more about this workspace, please visit this short guide in our Community Handbook. You are welcome to check out our Code of Conduct, Contributing Guide, and Community Handbook when you can, as well.

:two: Want to learn how to contribute directly on Github? Learn more about the project? Chat with other community members?
:speech_balloon: Our next Onboarding Call is planned for 26 March January 2025 - which you can sign up for on google forms. We'll also share more initiatives you can get involved in, like working groups, events, and talks. Join us!

:speech_balloon: Alternatively, you can also join our Collaboration Cafe – our bi-monthly community-wide coworking call (hosted twice every month from 15-17 London time - during the same range as the Onboarding call, just 2 hours instead of two, (though you don't need to stay the whole time!). The next call (and last of the year) is 19 March (TODAY!) – find the joining info here – no sign-ups needed! I'll also be posting about it on this slack. :coffee:

:speech_balloon: We have yet to schedule our first Community Forum call of the year, but stay tuned for the upcoming dates and calendar.

:three:  I want to jump into the deep end! What should I do?
Check out our general start page, which will link you to our Github organisation and repository. There are plenty of issues and pull requests to get you started, but check out good-first-issue or good-first-pull-request if you're feeling stuck!

These links embedded in this post all listed on this slack welcome page. I will also send it separately, as multiple embedded links are not accessible for screen-reader users on Slack!

As you get started, if you have any questions, please feel free to ping me directly here on Slack! :slightly_smiling_face: :slack:
