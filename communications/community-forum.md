# Community Forum

## Social Media

🏛️ Our Community Forum is this week!

Modelled off a political town hall event, these online sessions are an opportunity to better understand activities across the project and how decisions are made.

Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements. 

We expect that the calls will be a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

📅 [DAY] [MONTH] [YEAR], 15:00 - 16:30 London time
