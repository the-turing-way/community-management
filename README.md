*In 2025, The Turing Way's currently funded team at the Turing (which includes Malvika Sharan, Anne Lee Steele, Arielle Bennett, and Léllé Demertzi) who lead the project, manage the admin responsibilities and oversee community management will be forming a Working Group (WG) to transition some of these responsibilities to be carried out with the involvement from our community.*
