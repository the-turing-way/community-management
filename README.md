# README.md

This repository was created in January 2024 order to keep track of tasks for the community management working group:

* Hosting and facilitating community, onboarding, governance, and coworking calls and 1:1 mentorship calls
* Submitting, organising and presenting conference talks, workshops and trainings alongside community members 
* Facilitate contributions to The Turing Way guides and document community practices in Community Handbook
* Maintain the community platforms and infrastructure (i.e. Slack, Github, social media platforms)
* Provide operational and organising support for working groups and sub-communities of project
* Provide support on the alignment of TTW Governance transition
* Provide a secretariat role of the Core Staff Delivery meetings

The primary way in which the TTW RCM and RPM interact with this board is through the project board visual: https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/3/views/1.
