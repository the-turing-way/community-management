          - [ ] Who's owning slack management this month? Assign yourself!  
          - [ ] *Announcements*: post things and events to highlight in this channel 2X a month (traditionally it was weekly, but unless there is a need, I'd say let's trial for twice a month for now)

              - [ ] any TTW-related events? Fireside chat?
